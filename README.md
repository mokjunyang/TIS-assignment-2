<h3><ins>Reflections on Industry Visit 1</ins></h3>
<h4></h4>
On the 17th of December, we had an industry visit to the data centre in UTMDigital.

First of all, we were given a talk on various topics in one of the halls in the building. I learnt about services provided by UTMDigital and contact details in case of wifi or technical issues. Apart from that, I also learnt about the infrastructure of UTM Data Centre. Then, a speaker gave us a talk about the process of building the UTMSmart application. Lastly, a graduate of UTM gave us a talk about his journey during and after graduation, as well as some personal experiences when working with a team of programmers.

After concluding the talk, we were given a tour around the building. Our first stop was the UTM DigitalCare office. In there, we were led into various rooms and given a showcase of the office. There was a conference room that utilised a smartboard for conducting online meetings.
