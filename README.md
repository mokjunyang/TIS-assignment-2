<h3><ins>Reflections on Industry Visit 1</ins></h3>
<h4></h4>
On the 17th of December, we had an industry visit to the data centre in UTMDigital.

First of all, we were given a talk on various topics in one of the halls in the building. I learnt about services provided by UTMDigital and contact details in case of wifi or technical issues. Apart from that, I also learnt about the infrastructure of UTM Data Centre. Then, a speaker gave us a talk about the process of building the UTMSmart application. Lastly, a graduate of UTM gave us a talk about his journey during and after graduation, as well as some personal experiences when working with a team of programmers.

After concluding the talk, we were given a tour around the building. Our first stop was the UTM DigitalCare office. In there, we were led into various rooms and given a showcase of the office. There was a conference room that utilised a smartboard for conducting online meetings. Two technicians also gave us a talk about the structure of UTM DigitalCare.

Lastly, we were led to the main office in UTMDigital. There was a speaker that gave us a talk about the open office concept that was adopted by the office. Before we left, we interviewed one of the programmers there. We asked about his life working in UTMDigital and advice for undergraduates like us. 

I'm glad I was able to join this industry visit. It gave me an opportunity to peer into the operations of UTMDigital. It allowed me to familiarise myself with a key department in UTM that helps students with problems on the technological aspect.
